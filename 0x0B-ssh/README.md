This project deals with connecting to a server using ssh. But contrary to level 2, I will not connect using a password but an RSA key. The server has been configured with the public key created ina previous project shared in a intranet profile.

You can access your server information in the my servers section of the intranet, each line with contains the IP and username you should use to connect via ssh.
